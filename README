This utility uses the hpasmcli command line utility
to check the temperature on HP hardware. It can be used
as a nagios plugin or directly from the command line

It duplicates some of the functionality of Gerhard Lausser's awesome
check_hpasm plugin. http://labs.consol.de/lang/de/nagios/check_hpasm/o

The output of check_hpasm is quite verbose and I am too lazy to learn perl 
in order to modify it.

This script only checks temperature sensors

It requires Python version 2.2+ and has been tested on the following:
RHEL 3,4,5
